/**
 * Threads the host's data-resolution inputs from the canvas widget down to the
 * canvas nodes. openfused-local — depends on NO app paths.
 *
 * The app's mcp-host threaded `{registry, config, data, errors, depMap,
 * resolveUrl}` via `CanvasHostContext` because its registry components only
 * received `element` and had no other way to reach the host. openfused differs
 * in two ways:
 *   1. There is no registry to thread — `canvas-node` renders `node.widget`
 *      through openfused's own recursive renderer (`RenderNode` from
 *      `../render`), which resolves the registry internally. So `registry` is
 *      dropped from this context.
 *   2. `config`/`data`/`errors`/`depMap`/`resolveUrl` are obtained the SAME way
 *      top-level widgets do — the canvas widget (`widgets/canvas.tsx`) reads them
 *      off the `element.props._canvasHost` envelope the renderer threads in (see
 *      that file), which originates from the structuredContent payload in
 *      `main.tsx`. The canvas builds per-node `WidgetDataStore`s from them, each
 *      POSTing to the same `resolveUrl` (`canvas-data.ts`).
 *
 * This minimal context only carries those data-plane fields from `canvas.tsx`
 * down to `canvas-node` so each node can build its per-node store. It is the
 * cleanest seam: the renderer's `<Component element={...} />` contract gives a
 * widget only its `element`, so the canvas re-publishes the host data plane on a
 * context its own nodes read.
